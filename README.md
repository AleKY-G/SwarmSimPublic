# SwarmSim

This project implements the algorithms described in [REF].

Simulate swarms of planar mobile agents with first order dynamics and implement distributed control laws to obtain geometric lattice formation.

To execute your first simulation simply run Launcher.m.

Features:
  - Simulation of swarms of planar mobile agents with first order dynamics.
  - Distributed control laws to obtain geometric lattice formation.
  - Acquisition of metrics to evaluate the performance.
  - Adaptive tuning of the control gains.
  - Embedded options to test agents failure, dynamic lattice reconfiguration and actuation noise.
  - Extensive simulations to tune the control gains (see BruteForceTuning.m).
  - Extensive simulations to study the effects of the parameters (see SequentialLauncher.m).
  - Interface with Robotarium code to perform advanced simulations and real life experiments (see RobotariumSimulator). For more details and to use the Robotarium refer to https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu.
  - Plot functions to visualise the results.
